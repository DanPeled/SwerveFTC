# Swerve Drive FTC
> A library for using swerve drive in FTC, including a sample OpMode

## Notice
All units in the code are in the metric system (meter for length, m/s for speed).

## Expected Problems:
The rotation axis movement method of a swerve may differ, if needed to change from a simple axon servo, change in the `setPower` method in the `SwerveModule` class.

## Also Includes:
- contains the public [FTC SDK](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController) for the CENTERSTAGE (2023-2024) competition season *(may be needed to be changed)*
- [FtcLib](https://docs.ftclib.org/ftclib/v/v2.0.0) for the [WPI](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html) math classes and servo extension class.
